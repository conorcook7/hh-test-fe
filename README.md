This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Project

This is a simple project that lets you see an array of colors with the ability to select one. Once selected,
you will be taken to a new page that highlights the selected color with a template palette.

The backend for this project is in the other repository: https://github.com/conorcook7/hh-test-be.

This project can be seen from the hosted link: https://hh-test-7bs0rkc0n-conorcook7.vercel.app/

## Known Issues / Wishlist

1. Search Bar deosn't work. I wanted to get to this and no a good solution but ran out of time.
2. Small bug on DetailView -> some of the palettes will have a clashing key showing two of the same color.
   This doensn't always happen but happens nonetheless. I have a solution in mind.
